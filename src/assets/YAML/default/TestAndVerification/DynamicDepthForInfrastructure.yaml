Test and Verification:
  Dynamic depth for infrastructure:
    Load tests:
      risk: As it is unknown how many requests the systems and applications can serve,
        due to an unexpected load the availability is disturbed.
      measure: Load test against the production system or a production near system
        is performed.

    Test for exposed services:
      risk: Standard network segmentation and firewalling has not been performed,
        leading to world open cluster management ports.
      measure: With the help of tools the network configuration of unintentional exposed
        cluster(s) are tested. To identify clusters, all subdomains might need to
        be identified with a tool like OWASP Amass to perform portscans based o the
        result.

    Test for unused Resources:
      risk: Unused resources, specially secrets, might be still valid, but are exposing
        information. As an attacker, I compromise a system, gather credentials and
        try to use them.
      measure: Test for unused resources helps to identify unused resources.

    Test network segmentation:
      risk: Wrong or no network segmentation of pods makes it easier for an attacker
        to access a database and extract or modify data.
      measure: Cluster internal test needs to be performed. Integration of fine grained
        network segmentation (also between pods in the same namespace).

    Test of the configuration of cloud environments:

        leading to vulnerabilities.

    Weak password test:
      risk: Weak passwords in components like applications or systems, specially for
        privileged accounts, lead to take over of that account.
      measure: Automatic brute force attacks are performed. Specially the usage of
        standard accounts like 'admin' and employee user-ids is recommended.
